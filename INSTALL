Installation steps
------------------

The Templet package does not actually need to be installed.
Just copy the content somewhere on your disk and open 
Visual Studio project files ~/samples/*/vstudio/vstudio.sln.

Examples may require the propper settings for the Everest applications.
For more information on Everest applications,
please read the Everest tutorial http://everest.distcomp.org/docs/tutorial/.
